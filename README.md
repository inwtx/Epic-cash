NOTE: These are wrapped Epic tokens on Vitex for ease of use (not actual Epic<br>
coins). To secure your Epic on the Epic blockchain, you can unwrap by using the<br>
“cross-chain” feature to transfer to your Epic GUI or CLI Wallet. For info on<br>
creating a native Epic Wallet, click here.<br>
Helpful info:<br>
a.“Send/Receive” are for internal Vitex transfers (Vite users to other Vite users).<br>
These transfers are virtually free and very fast and easy to use. Thesetransfers<br>
use root addresses starting with “vite_”<br>
For example: vite_24465975848594040394858493030042959584<br>
b. Cross-chain deposits and withdrawals are used to transfer to/from Vitex and<br>
other platforms/blockchains, including native Epic Cash wallets. These transfers<br>
are more expensive and should be used sparingly only when needed.<br>
